# Week-1-Homework

For this assignment, I had to go through and refactor the code of this website.

* This site had more refactoring that was needed on the CSS side, than the HTML side.

* There was no Javascript to refactor.

* I changed a lot of the div tags to be more semantic like, nav, header, aside, footer, and more.

* On the CSS side there was a lot of repeated code that I combined together to help dry up the code.

* I also added comments on both the HTML side and the CSS side to help with readability.
